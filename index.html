        My name is Daniel Beckwith. I work as a software engineer at
        <a href="https://tulip.co/">Tulip Interfaces</a> and I live in
        Somerville, Massachusetts.

        I've always had a passion for <strong>creative</strong> and
        <strong>exploratory</strong> coding. The process of coaxing a computer
        into executing a procedure that emulates some concept I want to
        understand deeper is endlessly satisfying to me. This website documents
        some of the projects I've undertaken.

          An art project which produces images of swirling chaotic figures based
          on a simple dynamic simulation.

        <p class="description">
          The positions of many particles are traced over time to produce
          winding, intersecting trails. The particles move by targeting a
          particular position and heading for it. The target position is
          determined using the location of two other randomly chosen particles,
          or "partners". The target position lies "behind" the first partner on
          the line connecting the first partner to the second partner. Partners
          are chosen randomly, so the number of particles and the seed value
          product different networks of partners, which can produce a large
          variety of chaotic cyclic interactions. Simulation parameters such as
          the maximum acceleration of the particles, particle count, and initial
          particle positions also affect the result. The simulation is run until
          a set iteration count is reached. Finally the resulting image of the
          traced particle paths can be downloaded as a PNG or SVG.

          This project was a good way for me to test out using
          <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> in the browser. Rust is
          my favorite programming language, and the fact that I can use it to
          build apps like this targeting
          <a href="https://rustwasm.github.io/">WASM</a> for the web is amazing.
          It uses <a href="https://dioxuslabs.com/">Dioxus</a> to render the UI
          and the
          <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API">
            Canvas Web API
          </a>
          to render the image.
