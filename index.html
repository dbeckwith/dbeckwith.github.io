        My name is Daniel Beckwith. I work as a software engineer at
        <a href="https://tulip.co/">Tulip Interfaces</a> and I live in
        Somerville, Massachusetts.

        I have always had a passion for <em>creative</em> and
        <em>exploratory</em> coding. The process of coaxing a computer into
        executing a procedure that emulates some concept I want to understand
        deeper is endlessly satisfying to me. This website documents some of the
        projects I've undertaken and their meaning to me.

          An art project which produces images of swirling chaotic figures based
          on a simple dynamic simulation.
